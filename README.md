## OverOS Quick Start

### What is OverOS?
OverOS is a C++ based "overlaying" OS. This means it is simply an interface with it's own shell, directory structure, and APIs that runs over a basic underlying kernel (like GNU/Linux, for example).

### How can I get OverOS?
You have two ways of getting a working copy of OverOS on your machine. One way is to use `make` and build it yourself. Another way is to download [the latest release](https://github.com/sykeben/overos/releases/latest).
